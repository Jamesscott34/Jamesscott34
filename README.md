## About Me

👋 Greetings, coding comrades! I'm taking my first steps into the coding cosmos, currently enrolled in a software development diploma. With the thrill of being a coding neophyte, I'm mastering the basics of Python while simultaneously spreading my wings into the realms of C#, C++, and Java.

💡 As a fresh face in this digital realm, I find joy in unraveling the mysteries of algorithms and logic. Each line of code is a revelation, and every bug is a puzzle to be solved. The learning curve is steep, but the ascent is exhilarating.

🚀 Beyond the syntax and semantics, my gaze is fixed on the horizon of backend game development. The prospect of weaving intricate systems that power immersive gaming experiences propels my journey forward. The adventure is just beginning, and I invite you to join me on this coding escapade! 💻🎮🌌👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I’m James Scott, a developer and cybersecurity practitioner with a deep interest in building, securing, and automating systems.

I started with a Level 7 Diploma in Software Development, advanced into Networking and Systems Security (Level 7), and I’m now completing a Level 9 Postgraduate Diploma in Cybersecurity.
Each stage built a new layer of understanding from writing efficient code to securing cloud infrastructure and defending real systems against threats.

🧩 What I Do

App & Web Development:
I create practical, user-focused applications using Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, integrating both frontend and backend logic.
My projects often combine Firebase, local databases, and cloud services to build reliable cross-platform tools.

Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking:
I maintain a personal ethical hacking lab using Kali Linux, Metasploitable, Windows, and Android x86 environments.
My focus areas include penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, exploit development, and active threat defense.

Networking & Cloud:
Experience setting up Azure VMs, blob storage, and NSG rules, as well as hybrid cloud systems and secure backups.
I also simulate networked attack chains and defense scenarios across multiple environments.

Automation & Scripting:
I write scripts and utilities in Bash and Python for automating scanning, log analysis, and report generation.
My focus is on creating tools that save time while staying secure and transparent in their operation.

🔐 Current Focus

I’m currently working on:

AI-powered document analysis and secure automation

LLM-assisted cybersecurity tools and ethical hacking frameworks

Defensive automation with self-healing systems

Building full-stack secure reporting platforms that connect mobile, web, and cloud services
